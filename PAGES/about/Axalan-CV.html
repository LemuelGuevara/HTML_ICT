					<b>Insights About this Project:</b> <br>
					HTML is one of a student's biggest challenges in high school, unless that student is very ecstatic about it. I am a person whose opinion about HTML depends on the kind of activity. I can either be happy about it or incredibly disappointed. With this project, I am once again reminded as to how important time and communication is. My groupmates are very cooperative, but the short working time we had made us a bit rushed. The whole time while doing this project, I have been on the edge. My worries are starting to get the best of me. But seeing the fact that my groupmates are actively participating despite their tight schedules, it eased some of my worries. The thought about finishing this project motivated me a lot, because I honestly feel that we're about to get stacked by a hoard of works on the upcoming days. Finishing this project and successfully passing it lifted a heavy weight in me that I didn't realize I have been carrying.
