	<h1>Computer</h1>
	
	<h2>What is a computer?</h2><p>-Derived from the phrase "to compute," a computer is an electronic device that can store large amounts of data and
	perform various operations on the data. It is an electronic device that can store and work with large amounts of
	information.</p>

						devices such as smartphones and tablets.</p>
						<li>Windows</li><p>-Designed in the mid-1980's and was Microsoft Corporation's answer to the MAC OS. It was designed as an operating
						environment which ran on top of DOS rather than as an operating system itself.</p>

								</ul>
							</ul>			
						</ul>
					</ul>
				<li><b>Application Software</b></li><p>-Programs that work with operating system software to help the computer to do specific types of work. Application
				Software is specific to the task it is designed for and can be as simple as a calculator application or as complex as a
				word processing application.</p>
					<ul type="none">
					<li><h4><i>6 Types of Application Software</i></h4></li>
						<ul type="square">
